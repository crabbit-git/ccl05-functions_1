# What's this then?

This is my solution for a practice exercise assigned as part of a software development course. It  was assigned on the first day of the fifth week (Monday 14th March 2022) but for various reasons I'm only tidying it up and sticking it in a repository at the end of that week.

The "startpoint" directory contains the source files provided with the assignment, and "task.md" contains the instructions we were given. The code I wrote resides in `src/python_functions_test.py` but rather than running that file directly, the point is to instead run `run_tests.py` in the root directory to in turn run `tests/python_functions_test.py`, which runs several predefined tests on my code to ensure that the objectives of the task set have been met.


# Right... but what does it do?

Nothing especially exciting, it's just a bunch of simple bits and bobs showing the kinds of things you can do with a function. Some of it is numerical manipulations, some is to do with strings, some is more of the traversals around lists and dictionaries seen in previous labs. Have a poke around in `src/python_functions_test.py` in whatever text editor you like if you're particularly curious for whatever reason.
